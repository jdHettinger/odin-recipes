                    <strong>Prep your grill:</strong> Preheat your grill to 375 or 400 degrees F and scrape off any leftover bits from the last time you grilled.

                <li>
                    <strong>Add your chicken:</strong> Place your marinated chicken breasts on your preheated grill, and close the lid. It’s important to keep the lid of your grill closed while your chicken is cooking so that no heat escapes. Cook your chicken breast on the grill for 6-8 minutes on one side.

                <li>
                    <strong>Flip your chicken:</strong> After 6-8 minutes open your grill lid and flip your chicken breast with tongs. A great tip is to only flip your chicken breast once so that it stays nice and juicy (and creates delicious grill marks!)

                <li>
                    <strong>Check the temp:</strong> Cook your chicken breast for 6-8 minutes more. Cook time will vary a bit depending on the size of your chicken breast, so be sure to check the internal temperature in the thickest part of the chicken breast using a meat thermometer. When the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F, your chicken is done and can be transferred to a clean plate or cutting board.
                </li>

                    <strong>Let it rest:</strong> Immediately cover chicken with foil to seal in the juices and allow it to rest for 5-10 minutes before cutting into it. This will help you achieve that juicy, chicken breast you’re looking for!
